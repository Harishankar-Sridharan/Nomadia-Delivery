# 1. Introduction

**Nomadia Delivery** is a cloud-based SaaS solution designed to streamline and optimize logistics and distribution processes. The platform enables efficient management of delivery operations by organizing shipments into Missions---each representing a logistical flow of goods from a point of origin to a delivery destination. A Mission can involve a parcel, pallet, or any other transportable container. Each Mission follows a journey from a origin to destination. For example, a Mission could involve a pallet of vegetables departing from a central warehouse to be delivered to a local grocer. Missions are tracked using a series of statuses---such as Waiting, Received, Loaded, To Be Delivered, Delivered, and more---providing complete traceability throughout the delivery lifecycle. Additional information, including status history, photos, and key journey details, is also recorded to ensure comprehensive transparency.

The platform supports management of up to 500,000 Missions, with powerful filtering and sorting features available to help users focus on the Missions relevant to their operations.

**In the Backoffice**

* Missions (such as parcels or pallets) can be imported into the system through various methods, including Excel spreadsheets and APIs.
* "Each mission progresses through defined statuses until it reaches the 'To Be Delivered' status."
* Missions are then assigned to a specific Route, along with the designated delivery resource.

**In the Mobile Application**

* The delivery personnel continue updating the Mission statuses as they progress through their route, ultimately reaching the Delivered status.

**Note**: Each time a Mission status is updated, the changes are immediately synchronized with the Backoffice database in real time, ensuring consistent and up-to-date information across all platforms.
